# Exploring the Relationship between Grandstanding and Polarization in Congressional Hearings

Zining Chen 

In this replication project, I focused on the relationship between grandstanding and political polarization, building on Ju Yoen Park’s research. While grandstanding statements may appeal to a target audience, they may contribute more to political polarization.Because they have limited opportunities to please voters by making policies representing their interests, committee members will resort to making speeches to please them during hearings. However, in my perspective, grandstanding statements, though may favor their target audience or be rewarded by special interests (Esterling 2007; Ray 2018), have more effect on the growing political polarization.

This project is a replication project that builds on Ju Yoen Park research, with a more specific focus on discussing grandstanding’s relationship with political polarization.

##Datasets
The first two data sets are obtained from Ju Yoen Park research’s replication package on Harvard Dataverse. Both contain hearing transcripts on 12,820 House hearings from the 105th to 114th Congresses. All data was filtered to include only the 112th Congress and later for up-to-date research.

The first data set used is named [Data_speech](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/GSMBFX&version=1.0). It contains statement-level House hearing data: a “grandstanding score” for each individual statement made by committee members (a score calculated in her study using a crowd-sourced supervised learning method). This data set is not attachted in the repo since it is over 100MB. However the dataset can be accessed through the embedded link.

The second data set used is named[Data_member](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/GSMBFX&version=1.0). It contains member-level House hearing data: names and a “grandstanding score” for each committee member. This data set is attachted within the repo. 

The second data set is obtained from Voteview Github The data set provides information on Congress members from the 1st to 118th Congresses, ranging from the state they represent to their political ideology (DIM 1 & DIM 2 scores). This dataset is attachted within the repo data set folder.
